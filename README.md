# Braindose (Working title)

Braindose is an information storage and retention partner. The UI provides an elegant and intuitive way to store information that you wish to retain. Each peice of information can be stored in a "card" that can be easily recalled at any time. 

## Planned Features
There are several features planned for Braindose including the following:
- voice-to-text implementation
- text-to-voice implementation
- auto-tagging system for easy orginzation
- quiz modes
- public repos for cards based on categories

## Challenges

Other than the obvious challenges with intgrating several complex technologies, if the public repo for cards is implemented, there will be many hurdles to overcome with inappropriate or malicious content as well as security concerns.
